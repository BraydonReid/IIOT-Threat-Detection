# IIOT-Threat-Detection

Today is the age of networking and data used to increase workplace efficiency and safety. We 
have been doing this using “Industrial IoT,” which stands for Industrial Internet of Things [1]. 
Ultimately, this is an ecosystem of different devices, sensors, and applications that use 
networking equipment to collect, monitor, and analyze data from the workplace.[1][3] This 
analysis increases efficiency, reduces costs, and improves safety. However, the increased use of 
networking to communicate across devices also leaves room for various attacks over the 
network. Failure of Industrial IoT can have significant consequences, such as injury or death. The 
motivation behind this project is to increase the security of Industrial IoT by being able to 
distinguish between normal network behavior and potential attacks on the network.  
The proposed solution will be able to aggregate and transform real-time data into meaningful 
features that can be used to detect patterns. By using machine learning, the system can 
distinguish between normal network behavior and potential attacks over the network. This will 
also be for early detection and quicker response time to ensure that any anomaly in the network 
can be addressed to prevent any disruption or safety hazards in the Industrial IoT environment.[2]
